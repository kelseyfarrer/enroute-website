## 🔄 Alternative: Use Temporary Placeholders

If you don't have images ready, you can use placeholder images temporarily:

### Option 1: Unsplash (Free, High-Quality)
Visit [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com) and search for:
- "architecture" (for hero)
- "incense smoke" (for atmosphere)
- "interior design" (for projects)
- "bohemian decor" (for approach section)

### Option 2: Your Phone Camera
Take quick photos of:
- Design magazines or books
- Your own space
- Styled flat lays
- Textures and details

**Remember**: These are just placeholders. Replace with your actual project photos ASAP!

## 🎯 Image Style Guide

To maintain visual consistency:

### Color Palette
Your images should lean toward:
- Warm earth tones (browns, terracotta, beige)
- Natural textures (wood, stone, textiles)
- Soft lighting (avoid harsh shadows)
- Bohemian, layered aesthetic

### What Works Well:
✅ Architectural details
✅ Textural close-ups
✅ Styled vignettes
✅ Natural materials
✅ Warm, diffused lighting
✅ Layers and depth

### What to Avoid:
❌ Overly bright/fluorescent lighting
❌ Cluttered backgrounds
❌ Poor quality/grainy photos
❌ Inconsistent color grading
❌ Watermarks or logos

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Consistency
- Use the same photo editing style across all images
- Keep white balance consistent (warm tones, not too cool)
- Maintain similar composition styles

### Mobile Optimization
- Test how images look on mobile devices
- Avoid text in images (hard to read on small screens)
- Ensure focal points are centered

### Alt Text
The `alt` attribute in your HTML describes images for:
- Screen readers (accessibility)
- SEO (search engines)
- When images fail to load

Always make them descriptive:
- ❌ Bad: `alt="image1"`
- ✅ Good: `alt="Bohemian living room with layered textiles and floor pillows"`

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Image not showing?
1. Check the file path is correct
2. Ensure filename matches exactly (case-sensitive!)
3. Verify file is actually in the folder
4. Try refreshing the page (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)

### Image looks blurry?
- Upload a higher resolution version
- Minimum 1920px for hero images
- Use quality setting of 80-90% when optimizing

### Image loads slowly?
- File is too large, optimize it
- Target under 500KB for hero, under 200KB for others
- Use TinyPNG or Squoosh

### Wrong aspect ratio?
- Crop image to match recommended dimensions
- Use CSS to adjust if needed (ask for help)
