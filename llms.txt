# En Route Studio

> Interior design, event styling, and experience design studio based in Los Angeles, California.

## About
En Route Studio designs transformational experiences and spaces rooted in ritual and steeped with intention. Founded by Kelsey, the studio works closely with brands and individuals who value beauty, ritual, and intention — translating their purpose into extraordinary experiences and spaces.

Our work draws inspiration from nomadic Bedouin cultures, ceremonial spaces, and wabi-sabi design principles. We bridge reality and fantasy through visual poetry — worldly, layered, bohemian luxury.
